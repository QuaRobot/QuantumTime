We propose **Quantum Time-index Models with Reservoir (QuantumTime)** ‚Äî a **quantum-classical hybrid model** for time series forecasting.

- üß† **Quantum machine learning module**: We integrate **variational quantum circuits (VQCs)** into the architecture to directly model the high-frequency components of time series. This quantum module acts as an implicit neural representation, enabling compact and expressive feature learning with significantly fewer parameters.

- üîÅ **Classical reservoir computing**: To capture sequential dependencies and improve extrapolation, we embed a classical **reservoir** module that provides dynamical memory and rich nonlinearity.

Our model builds upon and extends the framework proposed in the ICML 2023 paper:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Forecasting Model

You can train and evaluate the model using the following command:

```bash
python -m experiments.forecast --config_path=experiments/configs/'dataset_name'/'config_file' run
